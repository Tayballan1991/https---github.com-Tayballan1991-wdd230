                <p>For moving websites such as audible, netflix, and many others it is 
                    important to alignment on their websites. Without the alignment on 
                    auidble suspense novles could be in with biography or self help. 
                    Audilbe has their alignment set up that the books are set up in thier 
                    genera. By doing this it is easier for the cusotmer to navigate and 
                    find exactly what they are looking for.
